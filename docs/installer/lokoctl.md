These binaries can be manually downloaded and installed.

   signature.

2. Verify the signature. It should match one of the [Trusted
   keys](../../keys).

```console
gpg --verify lokoctl_0.5.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz.sig
```

3. Unpack it

```console
tar xvf lokoctl_0.5.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

4. Find the lokoctl binary in the unpacked directory and move it to its desired location

```console
mv lokoctl_0.5.0_linux_amd64/lokoctl ~/.local/bin/lokoctl
```

### Using 'go get'

You can quickly get latest version of `lokoctl` by running following command:
```console
go get github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/cmd/lokoctl
```

Once finished, `lokoctl` binary should be available in `$GOPATH/bin`.
