## Introduction

This guide provides steps to upgrade OpenEBS dataplane components from `v1.12.0`
to `v2.2.0` and migrate from cStor Pools/Volumes to latest CSI based
provisioning (CSPC Pools/Volumes).

## Prerequisites

To upgrade the OpenEBS data plane components, we need the following:

* Lokomotive `v0.6.0`
    ```bash
    lokoctl version
    v0.6.0
    ```

* A Lokomotive cluster accessible via `kubectl` deployed on a
  [Equinix metal](../configuration-reference/platforms/packet.md) or
  [Bare metal](../configuration-reference/platforms/baremetal.md).

* OpenEBS `v1.12.0` installed. You can check if OpenEBS is indeed in expected
    version:
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods -n openebs -n openebs.io/version=1.12.0
    ```

* Highly recommended to schedule a downtime for the applications consuming the
  OpenEBS PV and make sure to take a backup of the data before starting the
  below upgrade procedure. Lokomotive provides
  [Velero](../configuration-reference/components/velero.md) component for backup
  and restore.

* Ensure the cluster and OpenEBS volumes are is in healthy state before proceeding.
    ```bash
    $ lokoctl health
    Node                    Ready    Reason          Message

    alpha-controller-0      True     KubeletReady    kubelet is posting ready status
    alpha-large-worker-0    True     KubeletReady    kubelet is posting ready status
    Name      Status    Message              Error

    etcd-0    True      {"health":"true"}


   $ kubectl get cstorpools -n openebs # Status should be Healthy.

   NAME                                ALLOCATED   FREE   CAPACITY   STATUS    READONLY   TYPE      AGE
   cstor-pool-openebs-replica-1-w3r7   6.98G       437G   444G       Healthy   false      striped   4d22h


   $ kubectl get cstorvolume -n openebs # Status should be Healthy.

   NAME                                       STATUS    AGE     CAPACITY
   pvc-183dc3df-a7d9-4273-a8e2-7f66d2e19f4e   Healthy   3d20h   50Gi
   pvc-5d4b4c2b-2ed5-4e75-aeb9-fbd2918ebb78   Healthy   3d20h   50Gi
   ```
## Steps

### Step 1: Upgrade OpenEBS control plane components

Lokomotive provides an easy way of upgrading the OpenEBS control plane.

Execute the following command to upgrade OpenEBS control plane:

```bash
lokoctl component apply openebs-operator
```

Doing so, terminates the OpenEBS resources associated with `v1.12.0` and new
resources are created with `v2.2.0`.

Verify all the pods are in `Running` state before proceeding:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n openebs -n openebs.io/version=2.2.0
```

### Step 2: Upgrade OpenEBS data plane components

OpenEBS control plane and data plane components work independently. Even if the
control plane components are upgraded to `v2.2.0`, the data plane components
continue to work with the older version `v1.12.0`.

#### Upgrade cStor pools

Get existing `StoragePoolClaims` by executing:

```bash
kubectl get spc
NAME                           AGE
cstor-pool-openebs-replica-3   2d21h26m
```

Create a Job to upgrade the existing cStor pools:

```bash
OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION=2.2.0
OPENEBS_OLD_VERSION=1.12.0
cat > upgrade-cstor-pools-1120-220.yaml <<EOF
# upgrade-cstor-pools-1120-220.yaml

#This is an example YAML for upgrading cstor SPC.
#Some of the values below needs to be changed to
#match your openebs installation. The fields are
#indicated with VERIFY
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  #VERIFY that you have provided a unique name for this upgrade job.
  #The name can be any valid K8s string for name. This example uses
  #the following convention: cstor-spc-<flattened-from-to-versions>
  generateName: cstor-spc-1120220-
  namespace: openebs

spec:
  backoffLimit: 4
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: openebs-operator
      containers:
      - name:  upgrade
        args:
        - "cstor-spc"

        # --from-version is the current version of the pool
        - "--from-version=${OPENEBS_OLD_VERSION}"

        # --to-version is the version desired upgrade version
        - "--to-version=${OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION}"

        # Bulk upgrade is supported
        # To make use of it, please provide the list of SPCs
        # as mentioned below
        - "cstor-pool-openebs-replica-3"

        #Following are optional parameters
        #Log Level
        - "--v=4"
        #DO NOT CHANGE BELOW PARAMETERS
        env:
        - name: OPENEBS_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        tty: true

        # the image version should be same as the --to-version mentioned above
        # in the args of the job
        image: openebs/m-upgrade:${OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION}
        imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
EOF
```

Apply the job to start the upgrade for cStor pools:

```bash
kubectl create -f upgrade-cstor-pools-1120-220.yaml
```

Ensure the job runs to completion.


#### Upgrade cStor volumes

Get existing `CStorVolumes` by executing:

```bash
k get cstorvolumes --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE   NAME                                       STATUS    AGE     CAPACITY
openebs     pvc-5b7d8ee3-59b8-4a02-bd6d-a4e66fbecf9f   Healthy   2d21h   50Gi
openebs     pvc-e8f8b268-b81c-4201-841a-283f557c44a7   Healthy   2d21h   50Gi
```


Create a Kubernetes job to upgrade the existing cStor volumes:

```bash
OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION=2.2.0
OPENEBS_OLD_VERSION=1.12.0
cat > upgrade-cstor-vols-1120-220.yaml <<EOF
# upgrade-cstor-vols-1120-220.yaml

#This is an example YAML for upgrading cstor volume.
#Some of the values below needs to be changed to
#match your openebs installation. The fields are
#indicated with VERIFY
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  #VERIFY that you have provided a unique name for this upgrade job.
  #The name can be any valid K8s string for name. This example uses
  #the following convention: cstor-vol-<flattened-from-to-versions>
  generateName: cstor-vol-1120220-
  namespace: openebs

spec:
  backoffLimit: 4
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: openebs-operator
      containers:
      - name:  upgrade
        args:
        - "cstor-volume"

        # --from-version is the current version of the volume
        - "--from-version=${OPENEBS_OLD_VERSION}"

        # --to-version is the version desired upgrade version
        - "--to-version=${OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION}"

        # Bulk upgrade is supported from 1.9
        # To make use of it, please provide the list of PVs
        # as mentioned below
        - "pvc-5b7d8ee3-59b8-4a02-bd6d-a4e66fbecf9f"
        - "pvc-e8f8b268-b81c-4201-841a-283f557c44a7"

        #Following are optional parameters
        #Log Level
        - "--v=4"
        #DO NOT CHANGE BELOW PARAMETERS
        env:
        - name: OPENEBS_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        tty: true

        # the image version should be same as the --to-version mentioned above
        # in the args of the job
        image: openebs/m-upgrade:${OPENEBS_NEW_VERSION}
        imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl create -f upgrade-cstor-vols-1120-220.yaml
```

Ensure the job runs to completion.

### Step 3: Verify

To check if the upgrade process was successful, execute:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n openebs -n openebs.io/version=2.2.0

```

To check if all the `StoragePoolClaims` and `CStorVolumes` have been upgraded,
execute:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n openebs -n openebs.io/version=1.12.0
```
No output should be displayed.
